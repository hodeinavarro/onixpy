# Contributing to onixpy

Thank you for considering contributing to onixpy! We welcome bug reports, documentation improvements, tests, and code changes.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and open an issue describing your planned change (unless it is a trivial fix).
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-change`.
3. Run tests and linters locally: `uv run pytest` and `uv run ruff check .`.
4. Open a pull request and reference the issue.

## AI Assistance Notice

**The onixpy project allows AI-assisted code contributions, but these must be disclosed in the pull request.**

- If you used AI assistance (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.), you **must** add a short disclosure in the PR description that explains:
  - Which tool(s) were used, and
  - The extent of the assistance (e.g., "docs only", "code generation for function X", "research and explanation only").

Example disclosures:

- `This PR was written primarily by ChatGPT. I reviewed, tested, and edited the generated code.`
- `I consulted ChatGPT for implementation ideas but authored the final changes manually.`

Notes and expectations:

- AI assistance is *not* a substitute for human understanding. Contributors must be able to explain and defend the changes in the PR.
- Test and verify all changes locally. If platform-specific functionality exists (e.g., Linux/macOS differences), ensure the change is verified on the relevant platforms.
- Trivial use of AI for tab-completion or small commit-message generation does not require a disclosure.
- We reserve the right to close PRs that lack adequate human accountability or that appear to be indiscriminately generated by AI without testing.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and focused. If implementing a large feature, consider opening an issue first.
- Include tests for new functionality and ensure all tests pass.
- Update documentation when relevant.

Thanks again — we appreciate your help and will review PRs in a timely manner.
